•	What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?
In this course, I learned how to move an existing application into the AWS Cloud.  Specifically, what stood out to me was the ability to refactor the existing code, move it into a Docker container, and to wire the Lambda and API functions to interact with an S3 Bucket successfully.  

 Describe your strengths as a software developer.
As a software developer, overall system design and project management are particularly exciting to me.  Cloud design I see as an extension of that.  Coding, and refactoring pre-existing code to work efficiently on cloud platforms as well as selecting and effectively managing those essential services creates not only a best-in-class experience for end users, but also a great value for the company providing that service as well.

•	Identify the types of roles you are prepared to assume in a new job.
Having the advantage of a CS degree with a focus on Data Analytics makes cloud based products particularly appealing from a data storage and analytics perspective. This combined with my database design and query knowledge prepares me for the data analytics role that I have been working towards returning to.
